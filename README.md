What is TIA Music Explorer?

It is a music app for exploring and understanding the sound palette for TIA audio chip on the Atari 2600 & 7800 game consoles. It offers functionality for live performance and music theory analysis. Recording and data export is planned for the next major update. There are several selectable tones: TIA, pseudo-piano, and four wave tones; and two selectable note scales: TIA scale and piano scale.
